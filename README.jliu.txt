TODO:

the kg_allow tol defautl value is 0.5 it is too big for meter dimension

horizontal plane for wind.

what i need to get 

free surface correction

flooding

CLR hand calculation

DTU, afloat and load on/off drafts and wind speeds 

ABS MODU 3-3-1 section 1.3.2(a) is collision, 1.3.2(b) flooding

auto flood compartment to achieve the designed draft

?how to define watertight compartment
?how to understand the ability to compensate for damage incurred, by pumping out or by ballasting other
 compartments, etc., is not to be considerated as alleviating the requirements of 3-3-1/3.3.2-3.3.4
